Two to Four players: Blue (PB), Red (PR), Yellow (PY), Green (PG) (Yellow and Green as needed)
Each player: 4 Cities, 4 Settlements, 15 Roads
A board: 19 Hex, 54 Nodes, 72 Paths, 9 Harbors, 1 Robber, 25 Development Cards,
         Pools of Ore, Grain, Lumber, Wool, Brick Resources
Each Hex: A resource, a production value, 6 Nodes (overlapping w/ other Hex), 6 Paths (overlapping w/ other Hex).
          These are keyed H00..H18 and have a predefined oeder. There are a total of 4 Grain Lumber and Wool, 3 Ore
          Brick, and 1 lack of resource (Desert). These begin in an array R00...R18 and are shuffled prior to the game
          then assigned R->H.
Each Node: Empty to start, can contain a City or Settlement from a player, connected via Roads on Paths. May also contain
           access to a Harbor. These are keyed N00..N53 and have a defined order.
Each Path: Empty to start, can contain a Road from a player, connects Nodes and other paths
           These are keyed P00..P71 and have a defined order.
Each Harbor: Allows players to access a specific upgrade to trading particular Resources. These Harbors are attached
             to predefined Nodes, but the benefits they give are randomized during board setup. There is 1 Harbor for
             each specific Resource which allows for 2:1 trade, and 4 Harbors that allow for 3:1 trade for any resource.
             These are keyed M00..M08 and are shuffled prior to the game.
Robber: Halts production of resources for a specific node and allows players to steal cards from each other.
        Keyed ROB. The Robber is moved when a 7 is rolled or a Development Card: Soldier is played. The Robber
        it then moved to a Hex of the player's choosing and he is allowed to take 1 random Resource card from one
        owner of a City or Settlement built on an attached Node.
Development Cards: Contain benefits for players, purchased with Resources. Keyed D0...D24 and shuffled prior to the
                   game. Once in a player's hand, they are only visible to the player until they chose to use its benefit,
                   at which point all players are aware of it. The card is then discarded and removed from the game.
Cities / Settlements: Allow for player resource accumulation, purchased with other resources. These are keyed
                      CIT0PB..CIT3PB, SET0PB..SET4PB, with variants for each player.
Roads: Allow for players to lead to new nodes to build new Cities / Settlements. These are keyed RD00PB..RD14PB with
       variants for each player.
Resource Cards: Each player can collect these and hold them in their hand to be used as currency. At any time, a 
                player may trade 4 of a single type for 1 of another. This can be discounted through building a City
                or Settlement on a node connected to a Harbor. These are keyed RC00PB...RC29PB and can contain
                resources keyed ORE, GRA, LUM, WOO, BRI.

The game also runs on a 2 Die rolling system, keyed DIE0 and DIE1. This value will always be given to the players
at the beginning of any turn, as it dictates which resources are produced that turn

Things purchased with resources:
    Road = 1 Brick 1 Lumber. Placed on empty Path, must connect to an existing player's City / Settlement or Path.
    Settlement = 1 Brick 1 Lumber 1 Wool 1 Grain. Placed on empty node, must connect to an existing player's
                 road and there must not be any cities / settlements for any player in a directly adjacent node.
    City = 3 Ore 2 Grain. Replaces a player's already existing Settlement. The settlement is removed back to
           the player's settlement pool.
    Development Card = 1 Ore 1 Wool 1 Grain. Goes into a player's hand to be played at the player's discretion.
    
Things that give victory points:
    Settlement - 1 point each
    City - 2 points each
    Having the largest army - 2 points
    Having the longest road - 2 points
    Certain development cards - 1 point each

The goal of the game is to accumulate 10 victory points fastest, and the player can get there various ways. The players
build their settlements, cities, and roads to expand the territory of the board they control to allow for increased
resource production. Players may also purchase development cards to aquire cards that help them in specific ways, as
well as victory points directly.



PB gets and empty state {} and does:

[set(players,2), // assume 2 players
set(turn,PB),
set(R00,"Resource 0"),...,set(R18,"Resource 18"), // defines the Resource tiles the game needs in proper numbers
shuffle(R00,R25), // randomize the Resources to be applied to the Hex
set(H00,R0O),...,set(H18,R18), // applies the randomized Resources to defined Hexes
setVisibility(H00,[PB,PR]),...,setVisibility(H18,[PB,PR,PY,PG]), // all the Hexes are always visible
set(M00,"Harbor 0"),...,set(M08,"Harbor 8"), // set the Harbor bonuses
shuffle(M00,M08), // randomize the Harbor bonuses
set(D00,"Card Description 0"),...,set(D24,"Card Description 24"), // sets all 25 Development Cards with their specifics
shuffle(D00,25), // randomize the Development Card stack
setVisibility(D00,[]),...,setVisibility(D24,[]), // all the cards begin not visible

And then the random winner of the roll gets this state (call it PB for now):
(This is a pre-initial state. There is initial staging needed to be done once the physical board is set based on
input from the players)
turn:PBPre0
D00:null,...,D24:null
H00:"Resource 7",...,H18:"Resource 13", // this is random
N00:[],...,N53:[], // Nodes are initially empty, can eventually contain CIT or SET
P00:[],...,P71:[], // Paths are initially empty, can eventually contain RD
M00:"Harbor 3",...,M08:"Harbor 1", // So the players know where the Harbors ended up
(The game internally knows which Nodes and Paths are connected to each other,
 as well as which Nodes are tied to what Hexes and which Harbors are tied to
 which Nodes. This is constant for every game)
ROB:H10, // the Robber begins wherever the Hex with no resource (Desert) is
RC00PB:[],...,RC29PB:[],
RC00PR:[],...,RC29PR:[],
(All players start with no cards, and each player knows how many cards each opponent has in their hand, but are
only allowed to know the specific values of the cards in their own hand. So in subsequent turns, the values of
RC00PB will be either [] or ORE (some resource)) and the values of RC00PR will be either [] or null)

From this state, each player from random initial player in order to the end (PB -> PR in this case) places a
single free Settlement and Road on the board. Call this turn sequence Pre0.

Once Pre0 finishes, there is a second round of prep, running in order of players reverse of Pre0 (PR -> PB in
this case) the player places a second Settlement and Road, collecting a resource card for each Hex connected to
the Node chosen for this second Settlement. Call this turn sequence Pre1.

The random initial player now gets to the real first turn:
turn:PB
D00:null,...,D24:null
N00:[],...,N25:SET00PR,...,N34:SET00PB,...,N53:[], // Nodes now contain 2 Settlements per player
P00:[],...,P30:RD00PR,...,P42:RD00PB,...,P71:[], // Paths now contain 2 Roads per player
ROB:H10,
RC00PB:ORE,RC01PB:BRI,RC02PB:LUM, RC03PB:BRI,...,RC29PB:[],
RC00PR:null,RC01PR:null,RC02PR:null,...,RC29PR:[],
DIE00:1,DIE01:2

With the die roll coming up 1 and 2, PB collects an extra resource for owning Node 34, which is attached to
Hex 08 and produces Resources based on rolls of 3.

It is now PB's turn. He can purchase as many things as he cares to and can afford, can make 
The PB player then chooses to build a road, and since it's not the end of his turn, he requests
his turn continue until he's finished.
[set(turn,PB),set(P35,RD02PB),set(RC01PB,[]),set(RC02PB,[])]

After this, he receives the state:
turn:PB
D00:null,...,D24:null
N00:[],...,N25:SET00PR,...,N34:SET00PB,...,N53:[],
P00:[],...,P30:RD00PR,...,P35:RD02PC,...,P42:RD00PB,...,P71:[], // The road is added
ROB:H10,
RC00PB:ORE,RC01PB:[],RC02PB:[], RC03PB:BRI,...,RC29PB:[], // The cards are nulled out
RC00PR:null,RC01PR:null,RC02PR:null,...,RC29PR:[],

PB now wants to end his turn, so he sends a single command to the server:
[set(turn,[])]

The server now knows PB is done, and shifts the turn to the next in line. PR is next,
and receives the state:
turn:PR
D00:null,...,D24:null
N00:[],...,N25:SET00PR,...,N34:SET00PB,...,N53:[], // Nodes now contain 4 Settlements
P00:[],...,P30:RD00PR,...,P35:RD02PC,...,P42:RD00PB,...,P71:[],
ROB:H10,
RC00PB:null,RC01PB:[],RC02PB:[], RC03PB:null,...,RC29PB:[],
RC00PR:WOO,RC01PR:ORE,RC02PR:GRA,...,RC29PR:[],
DIE00:6,DIE01:5

The die roll of 11 produces no resources for anyone since there are no settlements on those
Hexes. PR wants to buy a Development Card.
[set(turn,Pr),set(D,PR),set(RC00PR,[]),set(RC01PR,[]),set(RC02PR,[])]

With it, PR is allowed to see a new Development Card (D00 in this case) and the Resource
cards in their hand is now empty.

turn:PR
D00:"Card Description 5",...,D24:null
N00:[],...,N25:SET00PR,...,N34:SET00PB,...,N53:[], // Nodes now contain 4 Settlements
P00:[],...,P30:RD00PR,...,P35:RD02PC,...,P42:RD00PB,...,P71:[],
ROB:H10,
RC00PB:null,RC01PB:[],RC02PB:[], RC03PB:null,...,RC29PB:[],
RC00PR:[],RC01PR:[],RC02PR:[],...,RC29PR:[],

PR now wants to end his turn, so he sends a single command to the server:
[set(turn,[])]

PB now gets the state, and the cycle continues until the game ends.
turn:PB
D00:null,...,D24:null
N00:[],...,N25:SET00PR,...,N34:SET00PB,...,N53:[], // Nodes now contain 4 Settlements
P00:[],...,P30:RD00PR,...,P35:RD02PC,...,P42:RD00PB,...,P71:[],
ROB:H10,
RC00PB:ORE,RC01PB:[],RC02PB:[], RC03PB:BRI,...,RC29PB:[],
RC00PR:[],RC01PR:[],RC02PR:[],...,RC29PR:[],
DIE00:3,DIE01:4
